            <h3>What <em>is</em> coffee?</h3>
            <h4><em>Origins</em></h4>
            <p>
              The when and how coffee was discovered is largely unknown. Several stories and legends 
              exist to explain its origins. However, all coffee grown around the globe can be traced
              back to modern-day Ethiopia. During the 15th century, knowledge of the energizing "berries" spread from 
              Ethiopia to the Arabian peninsula, where coffee cultivation and coffee trade grew immensely.
            </p>
            <h4><em>The Coffea plant</em></h4>
            <p>
              Most of us may recognize a roasted coffee bean, but we may be unfamiliar with the actual
              plant itself! Coffee comes from the berries of Coffea plants.
            </p>
